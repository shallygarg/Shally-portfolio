            <p>
                My Name is Shally. I did my masters in computer applications and learnt French language for 3 years. While I was studying,
                I got an opportunity to teach French over the weekends. I loved teaching a lot. Language classes are a lot
                of fun and it gave me a lot of satisfaction when I saw my students speaking a foreign language. Part of my
                job was also to train students for Visa interviews in French.
            </p>

                I started my first full time job with Wipro Technologies in Bangalore, India in 2006 as a QA Engineer where I got opportunity
                to work with globalization team where I could use both computer skills and French knowledge. From there,
                I moved to Citrix Systems and spent 6 years helping improve the quality of several Citrix products.I also
                Got to take initiatives for several process improvements projects, QA activities.

                I moved to US in early 2015. In US my first job was with YouTube as a contract employee. I worked with YouTube for close
                to an year. After that I joined Nimble storage which is now part of HPE.

                Apart from work, I love visiting new places, spending time with my one year old son and hanging out with friends.

                That's pretty much it about my journey till now. Learning Web Development is the newest challenge I have taken that helped
                me create this page.
